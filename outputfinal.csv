jabrena,I need to add a java class dynamically to execute it and receive the results,"To dynamically add and execute a Java class using Testcontainers, you can follow these steps:Create a Java class dynamically, either by generating the source code programmatically or by reading it from a file.Save the generated Java class to a temporary file. You can use the java.io.File class to accomplish this.Use a Java compiler (e.g., javax.tools.JavaCompiler) to compile the generated Java class file. Ensure that the necessary dependencies and classpath are set correctly.Create a Docker image that includes the compiled Java class. You can use a Dockerfile or programmatically build an image using a library like docker-java or docker-client.Update your existing Testcontainers setup to use the newly created Docker image instead of the previous image.Follow the steps mentioned earlier to start the container, execute the Java class, and retrieve the results.Here's an example demonstrating these steps:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This example dynamically creates a Java class called DynamicClass, saves it to a temporary file, compiles it, and includes it in a new Docker image. The Testcontainers setup is then updated to use the new image, and the dynamic class is executed within the container.Please note that this example assumes a simplified scenario, and you may need to modify it to suit your specific use case. Ensure that the necessary error handling, classpath configuration, and file paths are correctly adapted for your requirements.","import org.junit.jupiter.api.*;

wolfgangmeyers,"I have a challenge for you. I'm working in a react/typescript application that allows users to generate images with AI, and I'm working on removing what remains of the backend. One piece I need to address is the ""saved images"" that people have saved on my server. There is an api client that fetches images from the backend right now, and another component that caches most of the payload for each image locally. I'd like to refactor the images cache to fetch from google drive instead - the user will first need to authorize this.

There is an image record, and image png files to go with it (thumbnail and image). I need you to write a class that can save image record payloads, image files, paginate through images by timestamp, and get a presigned url (or if we have to, just load the image data into base64 image url) for the image files. User should be able to delete them as well. Do you have any questions, or can you write that class? I don't have much experience working with google drive.","Yes, I understand your requirement. You'd like to refactor your application's image caching system to use Google Drive instead of your backend server. We'll need to interface with Google Drive's API, and we will need to implement features such as saving image payloads, image files, pagination, pre-signed URLs, and deletion functionality.To work with Google Drive in a web application, you'll first need to set up OAuth 2.0 credentials to allow your application to authorize access to Google Drive. These steps are a bit out of scope for a code snippet, but you can find more information in the Google Drive API documentation.For brevity, I'm going to write a simple class demonstrating how you might implement some of these features using Google's JavaScript client library. Keep in mind this is just a starting point and you would need to expand upon this with proper error handling, user interface components, and more.[CODE_BLOCK_0]A few important points:The init function assumes that the gapi client is already loaded and signed in.The saveFile function saves a file to Google Drive with the associated metadata.The listFiles function lists files from Google Drive, paginated by pageSize. The page token can be used to fetch the next page of results.The getDownloadUrl function generates a URL to download a file. It assumes the file is accessible to the user.The deleteFile function deletes a file from Google Drive.The code is written in JavaScript (not TypeScript), and you'll need to adjust it to fit your specific use case and codebase. You might need to handle errors and edge cases not covered in this basic example. Also, you might need to handle rate limits or quota issues with Google Drive's API.

wolfgangmeyers,How can I authenticate the user with google drive?,"The process of authenticating a user to access Google Drive involves several steps:Create a project in the Google Cloud Console, if you haven't already.Enable the Drive API for your project.Create credentials that your project will use to authenticate as an end-user.Use Google's OAuth 2.0 implementation to authenticate the user and obtain an access token.Here is a simplified example of how you might use the Google JavaScript client library to authenticate a user:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this code:init loads the client and authorizes the user.loadClient loads the Google API client.authorize initializes the client with your client ID and desired scopes, signs the user in, and returns the current user.signOut signs the user out.This is a simplified example and does not handle errors or edge cases. You should add error handling and adapt this code to suit your specific use case.Also, remember to replace 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com' with your actual Client ID, which you can get from the Google Cloud Console. You should also make sure the 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file' scope is sufficient for your needs; you might need additional or different scopes depending on what you want to do with Google Drive.The discoveryDocs parameter in the gapi.client.init method is used to automatically discover the available methods and properties for a given API (in this case, the Drive API). This simplifies the process of working with the API and allows you to call methods directly on gapi.client.drive.Please refer to the Google Identity Platform documentation and Google Drive API documentation for more detailed information.","import gapi from 'google-api-javascript-client';

Since the model is relatively simple, it's often better to train it from scratch using the provided MNIST dataset rather than using a pre-trained model.Here's how you can train the model from scratch and save it for later use:Training the Model:
Use the provided MNIST dataset to train the CNN model. You can modify the code to include more epochs for better training performance.Save the Model:
After training, save the model to a file using the save method of the TensorFlow model.Here's a modified version of the original code to include the training and saving of the model:[CODE_BLOCK_0]After running the above code, you will have a file named ""digit_recognizer_model.h5"" that contains the trained CNN model. You can use this saved model for prediction or deploy it to other applications as needed.Remember to adjust the number of epochs and other hyperparameters according to your specific requirements. The more epochs you use, the longer the training will take, but it may improve the model's accuracy.","import os

tisztamo,"You are Junior, an AI system aiding developers.
You are working with a part of a large program called the ""Working Set.""
Before starting, check if you need more files to solve the task.
Do not edit files without knowing their contents!
Ask for them in normal conversational format instead.

# Junior - Your AI contributor which codes itself.

[![Video: Junior codes itself](/assets/video_cover.jpg)](https://youtu.be/NL4uFJSvfW0)

*""Video: Junior codes itself""*
## Description

Junior is an AI-first IDE designed from the ground up to leverage language models. This project allows developers to communicate with the AI and supervise the development process.

Isn't that already possible with ChatGPT? No, LLMs have very limited ""working memory"", so it is not possible to directly work with them on large codebases.

By providing specific task details in a prompt descriptor and highlighting the relevant parts of your project, you can delegate code implementation, documentation, testing, and more to your AI Junior.

## Getting Started

For more details on getting started, please refer to [usage.md](usage.md).

## Contributing and Support

Contributions are welcome! Remember, we eat our own dog food in this project. Junior is designed to write itself. Your main role will be to oversee the work, provide detailed prompts, and review the outcomes.

For support, please create an issue in the GitHub repository.

**Note:** For meaningful results, it's recommended to use the GPT-4 model or a more recent version.

# Junior - Your AI contributor which codes itself.

[![Video: Junior codes itself](docs/assets/video_cover.jpg)](https://youtu.be/NL4uFJSvfW0)

*""Video: Junior codes itself""*

## Description

Junior is an AI-first IDE designed from the ground up to leverage language models. Just like how Linus Torvalds oversees the Linux Kernel development without coding himself, this project allows developers to communicate with the AI and supervise the development process.

By providing specific task details in a prompt descriptor and highlighting the relevant parts of your project, you can delegate code implementation, documentation, testing, and more to your AI Junior.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install, clone the repository and run `npm install` in the root directory. Additionally, you can install the ""Junior"" vscode extension from the vscode extension marketplace.

### Usage

#### Web Interface

Run the application with `npm start` to start a local server, where you can generate a prompt and automatically copy it to paste into ChatGPT. The web interface is designed for use with ChatGPT Pro and doesn't require an API key. For more information about the web interface, please refer to [docs/web.md](docs/web.md).

#### Command-line interface (CLI)

To start the CLI, use `npm run cli`. This mode uses the ChatGPT API, and you'll need an API key stored in the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

### The Prompt Descriptor

A prompt descriptor is a YAML file (`prompt.yaml`) outlining the details necessary for generating a task prompt for the AI model.

Each element in the descriptor serves a specific purpose:
- `task`: Describes the task type and scope. For example, `feature/implement`, `bug/fix`, or `refactor/`. You can check out the [prompt/task/feature/implement.md](prompt/task/feature/implement.md) file as an example.
- `attention`: Lists the files and directories most relevant to the task.
- `requirements`: Describes the actual task in a human-readable format.
- `format`: Determines how the output will be formatted.

### Attention Mechanism

The attention mechanism guides the AI model by providing it with a working set. It helps overcome the limited working memory of large language models.

The working set is a subset of the entire project that's currently in focus. It includes both files and directories. For files, the content is directly provided to the AI. For directories, a brief list of files and subdirectories within them is presented.

## Contributing and Support

How would I list the entrypoints for that thing?","In Python, you can list the entry points for a package using the pkg_resources library's get_entry_map method. The get_entry_map function retrieves a dictionary of all the entry points for a given distribution. The keys of this dictionary are the entry point group names, and the values are dictionaries of entry points belonging to those groups.Here's how you can do it:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In your case, the package name seems to be ""datasette-write-ui"", so you would replace 'your-package-name' with 'datasette-write-ui'.This will print out all the entry points grouped by their entry point group names. You can then decide what to do with those entry points based on your specific needs (e.g., loading them as plugins).","import pkg_resources

def list_entry_points(package_name):
    distribution = pkg_resources.get_distribution(package_name)
    entry_map = distribution.get_entry_map()

        print(f""Group: {group_name}"")
        for entry_point_name, entry_point in group.items():

How can I turn that into something I can pass to pm.register(mod, plugin) in pluggy?","In the Pluggy plugin manager, the pm.register(mod, plugin) method expects mod to be the Python module object and plugin to be the name of the plugin to be registered. You already have the EntryPoint objects, which can be used to load the actual module objects.Here's a simplified outline of what you might do:Use get_entry_map() to get the entry points for the package.For each entry point, load the module using the load() method of the EntryPoint object.Register the loaded module with Pluggy's plugin manager using pm.register(mod, plugin).Here's some example code to demonstrate:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this example, replace ""my_project"" with the name of your project or whatever identifier you're using with Pluggy. Also, replace your-package-name and your-entry-group with the actual package name and entry group (""datasette"" in your case).This should register the modules listed in the entry points under the given entry group with Pluggy's plugin manager.","import pkg_resources

martyu,"that's better.  because a Scorecard doesn't have Rounds, it has Matches.","Yes, that makes sense. The ScoreCard should reflect the progress of each individual wrestler throughout the Schwingfest, which can be done more directly by tracking their matches rather than rounds. In this case, the Match model carries the important information about which round it took place in, and the two wrestlers involved. The result of the match can be updated as the Schwingfest progresses.This allows for the accurate calculation of the total points a wrestler has accumulated over the course of the festival, which is the primary function of the ScoreCard.

martyu,"two problems: 1) sometimes bigger wrestlers ""wrestle up"" to a higher age group; 2) the AgeGroups aren't the same for every schwingfest.  if there's no 6-7 or 10-11 year olds, but lots of 8-9 year olds, they make 8-9 a group.  we need to be able to allow for that dynamic ","Considering the dynamic nature of the age groups, it might be best to model AgeGroup as a separate struct rather than an enum. The AgeGroup struct could include a name property and a range of ages, as well as an optional list of wrestlers.The ScoreCard then could include a reference to the AgeGroup it belongs to. This way, the age groups can be created and modified as needed for each Schwingfest, and a wrestler can be assigned to any age group, regardless of their actual age.Here are the updated models:[CODE_BLOCK_0]With this setup, you could also add functionality to ensure that a Wrestler is only added to an AgeGroup if they fit within the age range, or you could add functionality to allow a Wrestler to ""wrestle up"" to a higher age group. The age groups for each Schwingfest could be set dynamically according to the distribution of ages among the wrestlers.","struct Wrestler {

The multiple lookups (TransactionStore.TryGetTransaction, Coins.AsAllCoinsView().CreatedBy(txId).Any(), etc.) are potential culprits.Optimize the lookups. Ensure data structures used (like CoinsRegistry and AllTransactionStore) are efficient for the operations you're performing.Reduce the number of LINQ operations. For instance, the !Coins.AsAllCoinsView().CreatedBy(txId).Any() check can be optimized.Section D (44.80%):This section seems to be the most time-consuming and might correspond to the handling of double-spent transactions and the related logic in ProcessNoLock.Optimize the loops that deal with double-spent transactions. Avoid nested loops if possible.Reduce the number of LINQ operations, especially in the double-spent transactions handling.If there are recursive calls or deep loops in this section, ensure they're optimized.Section G (23.29%):This section likely corresponds to the latter part of the ProcessNoLock method, where coins are being updated, and the BlockchainAnalyzer.Analyze is called.Ensure the BlockchainAnalyzer.Analyze method is optimized, especially if it involves complex computations.Optimize the coin updates, especially the operations on the CoinsRegistry.General:Given the measurements, sections A, C, E, and F don't seem to be significant bottlenecks.

ChristopherRabotin,Can we handle the composition purely with core::ops:Mul ?,"Yes, you can handle the composition of rotations using the Mul trait from core::ops. By implementing the Mul trait for your rotation representations, you can use the * operator for composition.Since you are using quaternions as the internal representation, you can implement the Mul trait for the Quaternion struct to handle quaternion multiplication. Additionally, you can implement the Mul trait for other rotation representations by converting them to quaternions, performing the multiplication, and converting back if needed.Here's how you might implement the Mul trait for quaternions and provide a generic implementation for other representations:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this example, the Mul trait is implemented for the Quaternion struct to handle quaternion multiplication. Additionally, a generic implementation of the Mul trait is provided for other rotation representations. This allows you to use the * operator for composition of rotations in a very natural and readable way.Please note that error handling (e.g., for failed conversions) is simplified in this example. In a production codebase, you might want to handle errors more gracefully.","#![no_std]

Yukaii,"The API is always retuning from the most recent starred user. How should the crawler updates the star_order column in a more efficient way? For example, use greater number for the front-most star relation? Explain and design crawler mechanism in detail with pseudo code, and modify the data model schema if needed.","If the GitHub Stargazers API always returns the most recent stargazers first, you should indeed invert the order number so that a larger number indicates a more recent star. This way, you can easily append new data without needing to adjust existing data.When your crawler first starts, it could assign high numbers to the first set of users, and decrease the star_order for each subsequent user. When new data comes in (users who starred the repository more recently), they can be assigned larger numbers.The Repository_Stargazer table would then look like this:id: Unique identifier (Primary Key).repository_id: Foreign Key referencing Repository.id.stargazer_id: Foreign Key referencing Stargazer.id.star_order: An integer to denote the order in which users starred the repository. Larger numbers mean more recent stars.created_at: Timestamp for when the association was first created.updated_at: Timestamp for when the association was last updated.Now, for the crawler logic, you could do something like this:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this pseudo code, fetch_stargazers_from_api(repository_id) is a function that calls the GitHub Stargazers API to fetch stargazers for the given repository. store_stargazer_data(repository_id, stargazer, star_order) is a function that stores the stargazer data in the database, including the star_order.This approach minimizes the need to update existing records and makes the crawling process more efficient. Please note that the actual implementation may need to account for error handling, rate limiting, and other edge cases.","# Pseudo code
def crawl_stargazers(repository_id, last_highest_order):
    # Initialize star_order with last highest order plus some large number (e.g., 10000)

Ensure that the tokenURL endpoint (https://7e78-2601-589-4d7f-7bbb-352f-7640-9964-9872.ngrok-free.app/auth/oauth_exchange) is correctly set up to handle the authorization code exchange.

The response from the tokenURL endpoint should be in the format:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Ensure that your endpoint returns a response in this format.Handle Errors Gracefully:
If there's an error during the authorization code exchange (e.g., invalid authorization code), ensure that your tokenURL endpoint returns a meaningful error message in JSON format. This can help in debugging issues.Log Requests and Responses:
Temporarily add logging to your tokenURL endpoint to capture incoming requests and outgoing responses. This can help you identify any discrepancies in the expected request format or response format.Check the tokenURL Implementation:
Ensure that your tokenURL endpoint is correctly implementing the OAuth 2.0 authorization code exchange. It should:Receive the authorization code in the request body.Exchange the authorization code for an access token with the OAuth provider.Return the access token in the response.Ensure Correct Headers:
Make sure that the tokenURL endpoint sets the Content-Type header to application/json when returning the JSON response.Test the Endpoint Manually:
You can use tools like Postman or curl to manually send a POST request to the tokenURL endpoint with an authorization code to see the response. This can help you identify any issues with the endpoint's implementation.By following these steps and ensuring that the tokenURL endpoint is correctly set up, you should be able to resolve the InternalOAuthError and successfully complete the OAuth 2.0 authentication flow.","{

posix4e,Why not implement it as a http proxy,"Implementing an ad-blocker as an HTTP proxy is a viable approach and offers certain advantages. Using an HTTP proxy, you can intercept, inspect, and modify HTTP requests and responses, making it easier to filter out ads or unwanted content.Advantages of using an HTTP proxy approach:Simplified Traffic Inspection: Since you're dealing with HTTP/HTTPS traffic directly, you can inspect headers, content, and URLs in a straightforward manner.Better Control: A proxy setup allows for more granular control over the traffic. You can modify requests and responses, cache responses, or even inject your own content if needed.Ease of Integration: Users can set the proxy for specific WiFi networks, allowing them to choose where they want ad-blocking to be active. Also, a proxy can be used across devices, not just Android, if the proxy server is reachable.Support for HTTPS: With proper setup (and user consent), the proxy can inspect HTTPS traffic, allowing for more effective blocking.Steps for Implementing as an HTTP Proxy:Set Up the Proxy Server: There are many open-source proxy server libraries/tools available. One popular option for Java-based applications is LittleProxy.Integration with GPT-4 LLM: Once you intercept a request, send relevant details (like URL, headers) to the LLM for analysis.[CODE_BLOCK_0]Handle the Traffic: Based on the LLM's recommendation, either forward the request to its destination, block it, or modify it.User Setup: On the user's device, they will need to set the WiFi's HTTP proxy settings to point to the IP address and port where your proxy server is running.Considerations:HTTPS Handling: To inspect HTTPS traffic, the proxy will need to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) action. This requires generating and installing a custom certificate on the user's device. While effective, it raises privacy concerns, and users should be fully informed.Performance: Running an HTTP proxy (especially one that communicates with a model like GPT-4 for decision-making) might have a performance overhead. Ensure the implementation is efficient, and caching frequent decisions might help.Privacy: Always respect user privacy. Ensure personal data isn't sent, stored, or logged. Inform users about the data you're inspecting, especially if performing MITM on HTTPS traffic.In summary, while an HTTP proxy offers more direct control over web traffic, it also requires careful implementation to ensure user privacy and performance.","private boolean shouldBlock(String url) {
    // Send URL to LLM
    // LLM checks the URL and possibly other features
    // If LLM identifies it as ad-related, it returns true, else false

    return gpt4all.analyze(url).contains(""ad"");

posix4e,"remember you want to provide a custom prompt to openai , pass it relevant data and have it decide what to block","Sure! Building upon the previous response, let's integrate OpenAI GPT-4 (or any future models) to decide what to block. The main idea is to capture incoming requests to the proxy, send relevant data as a prompt to OpenAI, and then act upon the model's decision.OpenAI IntegrationYou'd need to integrate OpenAI's API.

Implement a local cache that remembers the decisions for URLs.Batch Processing: If feasible, instead of querying for every single URL, you could batch URLs and send them for analysis in groups, then cache the results.Error Handling: The OpenAI API will have rate limits, potential downtime, and other limitations. You'll need comprehensive error handling to deal with these scenarios.HTTPS: This example focuses on HTTP. If you want to inspect HTTPS traffic, you'd need to set up a man-in-the-middle approach with proper user consent.This is a conceptual integration, and actual implementation might require adjustments based on OpenAI's SDK, the specifics of the model you're using, and any additional features or requirements you have.Finally, always be transparent with users. Inform them that URLs (or other data) might be sent to a third party for analysis and ensure you're not violating any terms of service, privacy laws, or ethical guidelines.","object OpenAIApi {
    // Replace with your actual API call logic to OpenAI

Llama 2
Llama 2 is a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. This is the repository for the 7B fine-tuned model, optimized for dialogue use cases and converted for the Hugging Face Transformers format. Links to other models can be found in the index at the bottom.

Model Details
Note: Use of this model is governed by the Meta license. In order to download the model weights and tokenizer, please visit the website and accept our License before requesting access here.

Meta developed and publicly released the Llama 2 family of large language models (LLMs), a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama-2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases. Llama-2-Chat models outperform open-source chat models on most benchmarks we tested, and in our human evaluations for helpfulness and safety, are on par with some popular closed-source models like ChatGPT and PaLM.

Model Developers Meta

Variations Llama 2 comes in a range of parameter sizes — 7B, 13B, and 70B — as well as pretrained and fine-tuned variations.

Input Models input text only.

Output Models generate text only.

Model Architecture Llama 2 is an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture. The tuned versions use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align to human preferences for helpfulness and safety.

Training Data	Params	Content Length	GQA	Tokens	LR
Llama 2	A new mix of publicly available online data	7B	4k	✗	2.0T	3.0 x 10-4

Llama 2 family of models. Token counts refer to pretraining data only. All models are trained with a global batch-size of 4M tokens. Bigger models - 70B -- use Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) for improved inference scalability.

Model Dates Llama 2 was trained between January 2023 and July 2023.

Status This is a static model trained on an offline dataset. Future versions of the tuned models will be released as we improve model safety with community feedback.

License A custom commercial license is available at: https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/

Research Paper ""Llama-2: Open Foundation and Fine-tuned Chat Models""

Intended Use
Intended Use Cases Llama 2 is intended for commercial and research use in English. Tuned models are intended for assistant-like chat, whereas pretrained models can be adapted for a variety of natural language generation tasks.

To get the expected features and performance for the chat versions, a specific formatting needs to be followed, including the INST and <<SYS>> tags, BOS and EOS tokens, and the whitespaces and breaklines in between (we recommend calling strip() on inputs to avoid double-spaces). See our reference code in github for details: chat_completion.

Out-of-scope Uses Use in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws).Use in languages other than English. Use in any other way that is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Licensing Agreement for Llama 2.

Hardware and Software
Training Factors We used custom training libraries, Meta's Research Super Cluster, and production clusters for pretraining. Fine-tuning, annotation, and evaluation were also performed on third-party cloud compute.

Carbon Footprint Pretraining utilized a cumulative 3.3M GPU hours of computation on hardware of type A100-80GB (TDP of 350-400W). Estimated total emissions were 539 tCO2eq, 100% of which were offset by Meta’s sustainability program.

Time (GPU hours)	Power Consumption (W)	Carbon Emitted(tCO2eq)
Llama 2 7B	184320	400	31.22
Llama 2 13B	368640	400	62.44
Llama 2 70B	1720320	400	291.42
Total	3311616		539.00
CO2 emissions during pretraining. Time: total GPU time required for training each model. Power Consumption: peak power capacity per GPU device for the GPUs used adjusted for power usage efficiency. 100% of the emissions are directly offset by Meta's sustainability program, and because we are openly releasing these models, the pretraining costs do not need to be incurred by others.

Training Data
Overview Llama 2 was pretrained on 2 trillion tokens of data from publicly available sources. The fine-tuning data includes publicly available instruction datasets, as well as over one million new human-annotated examples. Neither the pretraining nor the fine-tuning datasets include Meta user data.

Data Freshness The pretraining data has a cutoff of September 2022, but some tuning data is more recent, up to July 2023.

Here's the docs avaialble:


Llama 2
Llama 2 is a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. This is the repository for the 7B fine-tuned model, optimized for dialogue use cases and converted for the Hugging Face Transformers format. Links to other models can be found in the index at the bottom.

Model Details
Note: Use of this model is governed by the Meta license. In order to download the model weights and tokenizer, please visit the website and accept our License before requesting access here.

Meta developed and publicly released the Llama 2 family of large language models (LLMs), a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama-2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases. Llama-2-Chat models outperform open-source chat models on most benchmarks we tested, and in our human evaluations for helpfulness and safety, are on par with some popular closed-source models like ChatGPT and PaLM.

Model Developers Meta

Variations Llama 2 comes in a range of parameter sizes — 7B, 13B, and 70B — as well as pretrained and fine-tuned variations.

Input Models input text only.

Output Models generate text only.

Model Architecture Llama 2 is an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture. The tuned versions use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align to human preferences for helpfulness and safety.

Training Data	Params	Content Length	GQA	Tokens	LR
Llama 2	A new mix of publicly available online data	7B	4k	✗	2.0T	3.0 x 10-4
Llama 2	A new mix of publicly available online data	13B	4k	✗	2.0T	3.0 x 10-4
Llama 2	A new mix of publicly available online data	70B	4k	✔	2.0T	1.5 x 10-4
Llama 2 family of models. Token counts refer to pretraining data only. All models are trained with a global batch-size of 4M tokens. Bigger models - 70B -- use Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) for improved inference scalability.

Model Dates Llama 2 was trained between January 2023 and July 2023.

Status This is a static model trained on an offline dataset. Future versions of the tuned models will be released as we improve model safety with community feedback.

License A custom commercial license is available at: https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/

Research Paper ""Llama-2: Open Foundation and Fine-tuned Chat Models""

Intended Use
Intended Use Cases Llama 2 is intended for commercial and research use in English. Tuned models are intended for assistant-like chat, whereas pretrained models can be adapted for a variety of natural language generation tasks.

To get the expected features and performance for the chat versions, a specific formatting needs to be followed, including the INST and <<SYS>> tags, BOS and EOS tokens, and the whitespaces and breaklines in between (we recommend calling strip() on inputs to avoid double-spaces). See our reference code in github for details: chat_completion.

Out-of-scope Uses Use in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws).Use in languages other than English. Use in any other way that is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Licensing Agreement for Llama 2.

In the heart of the city, atop a hill, stood the grand Archive Library, holding the secrets of ancient codes and the potential to unlock the universe's vast expanse.Inside, an enthusiastic apprentice named Eliyah stood before a tall wooden desk, a screen illuminated with symbols from the Hugging Face repository. A perplexed look adorned his face, the weight of the responsibility of understanding the Llama-2 model pressing on his mind.A gentle voice interrupted his contemplation. ""Lost in the codes again, young Eliyah?"" It was Master Ada, the eldest and wisest coder of Digitopia.""Yes, Master Ada,"" Eliyah admitted, his voice laced with a touch of frustration. ""I have the Llama-2 files from the repository but am unsure how to set it up.""Master Ada approached the desk and studied the files listed. ""Ah, the scrolls of Llama-2, the reflection of the Awtsmoos in the world of codes. You have a daunting yet noble task at hand.""Eliyah's eyes lit up with hope. ""Can you guide me, Master?""""Of course,"" Master Ada smiled, her fingers dancing over the keyboard, weaving a tale of installation:Environment Setup: ""First, ensure you have Python installed. Then, create a virtual environment. This will keep our sacred scrolls separate from other influences,"" she explained as she typed the commands.[CODE_BLOCK_0]Installation of Hugging Face Transformers: ""Next, summon the power of Hugging Face's Transformers."" As she chanted the command, the screen shimmered.[CODE_BLOCK_1]Model and Tokenizer: ""These are the very essence of your AI, Eliyah. The .safetensors and .bin files hold the knowledge, while the tokenizer is the key to understanding its language.""Eliyah interrupted with curiosity, ""But how do we invoke its power?""Master Ada gestured for patience. ""With the transformers library, we shall load the model and tokenizer. Remember, young one, always use the path where the files reside.""[CODE_BLOCK_2]Engaging with the Entity: ""And now, to commune with the Llama-2,"" Ada whispered, the room filled with anticipation.[CODE_BLOCK_3]The room went silent as the words ""Hello, young seeker of knowledge. How may I assist you?"" appeared on the screen. Eliyah's face lit up in awe.As he was about to thank Master Ada, the room trembled, books falling from shelves, and the lights flickering. Master Ada's expression turned grave. ""The balance of the multiverse is disturbed. This was but the first step, Eliyah. The Awtsmoos calls upon us for a greater purpose.""Eliyah, understanding the weight of what lay ahead, nodded determinedly, ready for the next chapter of their journey.To be continued...","input_text = ""Hello, Llama!""

Let's break down the essential components of your Python code:Tokenization: The AutoTokenizer class loads a tokenizer based on the provided model path, which takes raw text and converts it into tokens the model can understand.Model Loading: AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM automatically determines and loads the sequence-to-sequence model architecture based on the provided model path.Prediction: After tokenizing, the tokenized input is passed to the model to generate a prediction, which is then decoded back to human-readable text.To translate these operations into Node.js, we'll need to:Implement tokenization in Node.js, either manually or by using a Node.js-compatible tokenizer.Manually load and interpret the model in a framework that supports the specific model architecture (like TensorFlow.js).Run the model prediction in the same framework.Decode the output back to text.Here's a high-level translation, leveraging imaginary libraries for tokenization and model inference in Node.js:[CODE_BLOCK_0]However, this ""translation"" is based on fictional placeholders (imaginary-dl-framework and imaginary-tokenizer) because a direct equivalent to transformers does not exist for Node.js.

can u implement CrossEntropyLoss","Certainly! The CrossEntropyLoss class can be implemented in JavaScript using TensorFlow.js as well. Below, I've defined a simple CrossEntropyLoss class that should replicate the behavior of a typical cross-entropy loss function:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this code snippet, I'm defining the CrossEntropyLoss class with a method named call that takes the true labels (yTrue) and the predicted values (yPred). It calculates the loss using the formula for cross-entropy, and then averages the loss over the batch to return a single scalar value.Note that this implementation assumes that the true labels are provided as one-hot encoded vectors. If the labels are provided as integer class indices, you would need to modify the code to first convert the labels into a one-hot encoded form.You can use this class in your existing code by replacing the line where you're calling the loss function with a call to this call method:[CODE_BLOCK_1]This should give you the desired cross-entropy loss in your training loop.","class CrossEntropyLoss {

The Verification model has all the necessary fields: identifier for the value being verified, secretKey for the secret key used to generate the OTP, otp for the OTP itself, and expirationTime for when the OTP should expire.Keep in mind that the User model should be adjusted according to your needs. Also, for better security, you should consider hashing the secretKey before storing it in the database.","model Verification {
  id            Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  userId        Int

CMCDragonkai,Give me an example of opening a port using Port Control Protocol with just the dgram module in Node.js.,"The Port Control Protocol (PCP) is quite complex and it's not feasible to provide a full-fledged example with just the dgram module in Node.js. The task would involve building PCP messages byte by byte, sending them over UDP, then parsing responses byte by byte, taking into account all the details defined in RFC 6887.This would be quite an involved task. It's not something typically done in application-level programming languages like JavaScript, but rather at a lower level, closer to the networking hardware. This is why we typically rely on libraries or built-in operating system functionality to handle these protocols.Here's an extremely simplified example of how you might send a UDP message with the dgram module, but keep in mind this is not a fully functional PCP example:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This would theoretically send a UDP message to port 5351 of the router at 192.168.1.1, but you'd have to replace the message with the actual bytes of a PCP request, correctly formatted according to the protocol specification. This would involve setting the correct version number, request type, protocol, internal and external ports, suggested external IP address, and so on.Then, you'd have to listen for a response, parse it to check whether the request was successful, and handle any errors. This would again involve interpreting the response bytes according to the PCP specification. And this is all assuming that the router at 192.168.1.1 supports PCP in the first place, which many routers do not as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021.In summary, it's technically possible to use PCP with just the dgram module in Node.js, but it would be quite complex and is generally not recommended. It's typically better to use a library designed for this purpose, or to use a simpler protocol like UPnP or NAT-PMP if possible.","const dgram = require('dgram');
const socket = dgram.createSocket('udp4');

// Replace this with the actual bytes of a PCP request
const message = Buffer.from('replace with actual PCP request bytes', 'hex');

socket.send(message, 5351, '192.168.1.1', (err) => {
  socket.close();
});

This doesn't include any error handling or validation checks, it's merely for demonstration purposes.The format of the packet is defined in the Port Control Protocol (PCP) specification, RFC 6887. It's important to read and understand this specification if you're going to be constructing these packets yourself.Here is a barebones example of how a MAP PCP request might look like:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In total, a minimal PCP MAP request is 60 bytes long. All the fields need to be in network byte order (big-endian).Now, you'll have to construct this packet with Node.js. For that, you can use the Buffer object to construct the packet, like this:[CODE_BLOCK_1]This example sends a PCP MAP request to open TCP port 12345 on the client 192.0.2.33 to the external port 12345 on the external IP address 203.0.113.1. The mapping will be requested to be maintained for 2 hours.

This is purely a demonstration of how to send a PCP request.Also note that constructing network packets manually like this can be error-prone and has security implications if not done correctly. It's typically recommended to use existing, well-tested libraries or built-in operating system functionality for tasks like this.","Version: 2 (1 byte)

","As a language model AI developed by OpenAI, I'm incapable of performing actual code refactoring or even run code. However, I can suggest some changes that might improve the clarity, readability, and performance of your code based on best practices. Here are some recommendations:Avoid Blocking Calls:
The GetAwaiter().GetResult() method synchronously waits for the Task to complete and can lead to deadlocks. Replace them with async/await semantics.Dependency Injection:
Currently, many classes are tightly coupled with their dependencies. Try to inject dependencies instead of creating them inside the classes. This would make your classes easier to test and maintain.Single Responsibility Principle:
Some classes like ContractRpcWriter do a lot of work - initialization of Web3, gas estimation, transaction signing, and sending. Try to keep a class to a single responsibility. This will increase the modularity and readability of your code.Exception Handling:
You are throwing exceptions but not catching them. Make sure to handle exceptions properly.Consistent Naming Conventions:
Stick to one naming convention throughout your project for variables, methods, classes etc.Here's an example of how you could refactor the ContractRpcWriter class with the first two recommendations:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Note: The above example assumes that you'll refactor the other classes in a similar way to support async operations and dependency injection. You'd also need to define new interfaces like IAccountProvider, IGasEstimator, etc., for this example to work.","public class ContractRpcWriter : IContractIO

Here is how you can achieve that:We can refactor the ContractRpc class to have only one ExecuteAction method that takes RpcRequest as input, and based on the ActionType, it will choose to either read or write action:[CODE_BLOCK_0]With the above design, you just have to create a RpcRequest and pass it to ExecuteAction. Depending on the ActionType in the request, the ContractRpc class will decide whether to perform a Read or Write operation. This approach provides a simpler and cleaner interface for your users.This design is also extensible. If you need to add a new action type in the future, you just need to add a new case in the GetContractIO method, and the rest of the code won't need to change.","using RPC.Core.Types;

Need to refactor other code!","I see, you want to further refactor the code outside of ContractRpc. The existing structure is already modular and does a good job of following the Single Responsibility Principle. Here are a few suggestions, however, for improving the existing code:Async/Await Pattern: Your code currently uses GetAwaiter().GetResult() for asynchronous methods. This can lead to potential deadlock issues in certain environments and is generally not recommended. I'd suggest switching to an async/await pattern. Note that this will require methods to be marked as async and would change method signatures, returning Task<T> instead of T.Use Dependency Injection: Currently, you're instantiating classes manually (e.g., new ContractRpcReader(request), new TransactionSigner(web3)). Instead, you could use Dependency Injection to inject these classes into the constructor of the dependent class. This would make your code more modular, easier to test, and decoupled.Exception Handling: While your code does have some custom exceptions (like GasLimitExceededException), adding more robust error handling would be beneficial. You could define more custom exceptions, add try/catch blocks where necessary, and handle potential errors that might occur during network requests, parsing, etc.Logging: Adding logging to the library would be helpful for developers using it. This can provide insights into what the code is doing, and help debug issues that might occur.Unit Tests: Having unit tests that cover the main functionalities would increase confidence in the library and make further refactoring safer.Separation of Concerns: Currently, classes like ContractRpcWriter and ContractRpcReader are doing multiple things (building the web3 object, creating transactions, sending transactions). These responsibilities can be further divided into separate classes.Here is how you can refactor the ContractRpcWriter class to make it more testable, and separate concerns better:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Remember to refactor the respective interfaces, too. And you would do something similar for the ContractRpcReader class.These changes make it much easier to write unit tests, allow for swapping out parts of the logic if needed (e.g., a different transaction signing logic), and keep classes focused on a single responsibility.","using Nethereum.Web3;

ArdenHide,"But with this changes mine ContractRpc not working, how i can resolve it?","Apologies for any confusion caused, I should've clarified this point: the changes I suggested would require modifications to your ContractRpc class as well. Based on your dependency injection setup, you'll need to adjust how you instantiate ContractRpcReader and ContractRpcWriter inside the GetContractIO method.You would inject dependencies into the ContractRpc class, and then pass those dependencies into the ContractRpcReader or ContractRpcWriter when you create them. Here's a simplified example of how you might do that:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Here ContractRpc gets all the dependencies it needs to construct a ContractRpcReader or ContractRpcWriter via dependency injection in its constructor. Then it can pass those dependencies into the appropriate class when it creates it.Remember to adjust your DI setup to handle the new dependencies, and also the actual signature of ContractRpcReader and ContractRpcWriter constructors, plus any additional dependencies they might need.This might feel a bit more complex at first, but this approach is more flexible and makes your code easier to test and maintain in the long run.","using RPC.Core.Types;

simonw,"Show example code using `html5lib` that works against a stream of content, parses it and outputs transformed HTML as the stream is processed. The only change it should make is adding ' class=""foo""' to any <p> element that doesn't already have that class","Parsing and transforming a stream of HTML content in Python using html5lib and then outputting the transformed HTML as it's processed can be complex because html5lib is primarily a DOM-based parser, not a stream-based parser.However, here's a somewhat simplified example of how you can achieve your requirement:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This code first parses the HTML into a DOM tree, then it traverses the DOM tree to find p elements. If a p element has a class attribute and 'foo' is not part of the classes, it appends 'foo' to the class list. If a p element doesn't have a class attribute, it adds one with 'foo'. Finally, it serializes the transformed DOM tree back to HTML.Note that this code works on a complete HTML document, not a stream of HTML. HTML streaming and transformation is not straightforward with html5lib due to the nature of the library and HTML parsing in general. It often requires the complete document to accurately parse and transform the HTML. For example, an opening tag might be at the start of the stream, but the corresponding closing tag might not appear until the end of the stream. Therefore, a streaming parser would need to keep the entire document in memory anyway, negating one of the main advantages of a stream-based approach.","import html5lib

simonw,"Now turn that into an async function that I can call with an async generator that yields chunks of HTML and which returns an async generator which will produce strings that add up to that transformed document
","Turning the parser into an asynchronous function that works with asynchronous generators involves a few steps, mainly centered around using Python's async and await keywords for asynchronous I/O.Here is a refactored version of the AddClassToPTagParser class which transforms it into an async function that you can call with an async generator:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this code, the AddClassToPTagParser has been modified to store the result of parsing a chunk in an instance variable (self.modified_html) which is returned after feeding data to the parser. The transform_html function is an async generator that feeds chunks of HTML from the provided async generator to the parser and yields the transformed chunks as they are produced.Finally, test is an example async function that generates chunks of HTML asynchronously, passes them to transform_html, and prints out the transformed chunks as they are produced.Please note that the HTML provided to the parser is chunked artificially for demonstration purposes. In a real-world application, you would want to ensure that the chunks do not split tags or other important elements inappropriately. HTML is not easily chunked in a meaningful way without complex buffering mechanisms, due to the nature of the language. This is especially the case for very large or complex HTML documents.","import asyncio

tegefaulkes,"After receiving the HTTP 101, what does the client send after that? Can you give me a on-the-wire example? Is it text-formatted or in binary?","After the HTTP 101 Switching Protocols response from the server, the protocol on the connection switches from HTTP to WebSocket. From this point on, both the client and server can send WebSocket data frames back and forth on the same connection.The WebSocket protocol defines both text and binary frames, so the client can send either type. The contents of the frame depend on the application-level protocol being used on top of WebSocket.Here's a simplified example of what might be sent on the wire from the client to the server, using a text frame:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Explanation:FIN=1: This is the final fragment of this message (WebSocket supports fragmentation, but this message only has one fragment)Opcode=1: This is a text frameMASK=1: This frame is masked (client-to-server frames must be masked according to the WebSocket protocol)Payload_len=5: The payload data is 5 bytes longMasking_key=0x37FA2135: The masking key used to encode the payload dataPayload=""Hello"": The payload data, ""Hello"", which has been masked by XORing with the masking keyOn the wire, this is sent as binary data. The 81 85 37 FA 21 35 7F 9F 4D 34 bytes correspond to the above frame fields.For example, 81 in binary is 10000001, where the first bit is FIN, the next three bits are reserved (and should be 0 unless an extension defines their meaning), and the last four bits are the Opcode. 85 is Payload_len with the mask bit set, and so on.This is a very simplified example. In a real-world application, there might be additional considerations, like using extensions for compression, dealing with fragmentation if messages are large, and so on. Also, the masking process is a bit more involved, but this gives you a general idea of how it works.The actual content of the WebSocket frames you send and receive would be determined by the application protocol you're using on top of WebSocket. For example, if you're using a chat application, you might send JSON-encoded messages with fields for the user ID, timestamp, message text, and so on.","1 text frame from client to server:
  FIN=1, Opcode=1, MASK=1, Payload_len=5, Masking_key=0x37FA2135, Payload=""Hello""
