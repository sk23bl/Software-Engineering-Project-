DigitalGoldfish,"Is the type field necessary? I think it would be safe to remove this. I think I would like to do that so I don't have to have an additional relational table. Can we remove that?

The Verification model has all the necessary fields: identifier for the value being verified, secretKey for the secret key used to generate the OTP, otp for the OTP itself, and expirationTime for when the OTP should expire.Keep in mind that the User model should be adjusted according to your needs.

I've removed some details like the full datePublished, SHA256 checksums, and unnecessary repetition of publisher details (which were the same for both model files).

    ""description"": ""This is the 7B model from the Llama 2 family of large language models (LLMs), a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Meta's fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama-2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases. Llama-2-Chat models outperform open-source chat models on most benchmarks we tested, and in Meta's human evaluations for helpfulness and safety, are on par with some popular closed-source models like ChatGPT and PaLM."",
